# 🎮 Gaming Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing gaming-related data across different countries to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using Python and visualization tools.

## 📌 Objective

To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on demographic and gaming datasets in order to:
- Identify countries with the largest gaming user base
- Compare population vs. gaming interest
- Visualize gaming trends geographically
- Understand how demographic factors impact gaming statistics

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib 📈
- Seaborn 🌈
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Country-wise comparison of population and gaming users
- Top countries with highest gaming interest
- Correlation between population density and gaming statistics
- Visual representation using bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset used contains demographic data of countries and gaming statistics including:
- Country name
- Population
- Area
- Population Density
- Gaming user base (derived or provided)

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

- Bar chart of top 10 countries by gaming population  
- Scatter plot of population vs. gaming interest  
- Heatmap of gaming trends across continents
